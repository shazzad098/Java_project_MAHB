Project Title
<b>Library Management System</b>

Project Description
This is a console based Java project. You donâ€™t need to create a GUI for this project. To complete the project you must follow the following features:

User Information
Purpose: To allow users in this system to manage his/her books from the library
Details:
At the beginning of the application, you need to register some users (at least 5)
Those registration processes will be store at once (no need to entry information in everytime)
Login system is optional in this project
You can add some basic informations of users (full name, contact number, email, and address)
Adding Book
Purpose: Allow users to add new books to the library system.
Details:
Users can input book details such as title, author, genre, and a unique ID or ISBN.
The system will store these details in a collection (e.g., an ArrayList or a HashMap).
It will validate that the book's unique ID is not already in the system.
Searching for Books
Purpose: Enable users to find specific books in the library catalog.
Details:
Users can search by various criteria:
Title
Author
Genre
Unique ID/ISBN
The system will display matching results, showing details such as availability status (checked out or available).
It will implement a case-insensitive search to improve usability.
Managing Check-ins and Checkouts
Purpose: Allow users to borrow and return books from the library.
Details:
Checkout:
A user enters the unique ID of the book they want to borrow.
The system checks if the book is available.
If available, it marks the book as checked out and associates it with a user (if user details are managed).
A due date can be set for the return.
Check-in:
A user enters the unique ID of the book they want to return.
The system updates the book's status to "available."
If overdue, it can calculate and display a fine based on the number of overdue days.
Additional Features:
Display a list of currently checked-out books.
Track the history of check-ins and checkouts for each book.
Project Checkout and Member Information
This project contains three checkpoints. Checkpoints mean you need to present your project in front of your colleagues and faculty members. This is a solo project, so you cannot involve a person. 

CheckPoint #1
In this checkpoint, you are required to implement class and object, related OOP features, functions and array (1D or 2D). 

CheckPoint #2
In this checkpoint, you must implement exception handling and collections (ArrayList, Set, Map, LinkedList and so on based on your project structure). Also in this checkpoint you have to delete all features related to arrays and replace them with ArrayList. 

CheckPoint #3
In this checkpoint, you are required to implement String operations with File management. The Existing ArrayList feature will be retained as is, and you need to add file management features.
